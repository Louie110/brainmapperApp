<h1>BrainMapper Help</h1>

<p>BrainMapper uses MRI and CT brain images data to create 3D brain reconstructions showing electrode placement and optional labeled brain regions.</p>
        <h2> Using BrainMapper </h2>
        <p>Before beginning, you should have a set of DICOM images from the T1 pre-implant MRI in one folder and a set of DICOMs from a post-implant CT in a separate folder. It is best if each set has >100 images. </p>
        <p>Drag the folder where you would like to keep the results onto the Target Folder control bar in the BrainMapper program.</p>
        <p>Specify whether the resulting images should include segmentation (the output will color-code the brain's 35 regions) and whether the study included depth electrodes. If the study only included surface strips, then the images will be further manipulated to allow for greater visiblility of the electrodes.</p>
        <p>Drag the first DICOM image from each set onto the corresonding bar. </p>
		<p>Press START</p>
        
        <h2>BrainMapper Outputs</h2>
        <p>When finished, BrainMapper generates two files that can be used to generate a 3D reconstructed model of the brain. You will need to use ITK-SNAP to view these files.</p>
        <p>mri_brain.nii.gz is the base, grayscale image reqquired for viewing the 3D rendering. </p>
        <p>electrode_seg.nii.gz is the segmentation image required for viewing the electrodes.</p>
