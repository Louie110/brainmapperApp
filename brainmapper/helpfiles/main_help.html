<h1>BrainMapper Help</h1>

<p>BrainMapper cnan be used to coregister brain imaging data to create 3D reconstructions with electrode placement and labeled brain regions.</p>
        <h2> Using BrainMapper </h2>
        <p>Drag the DICOM image files into the tabs. </p>
        <p>Drag a folder onto the Target Folder control in the BrainMapper program to provide the location where the resulting images will be stored.</p>
        <p>Specify whether the resulting images should include segmentation of lobes and whether the study included depth electrodes. If the study only included surface strips, then the images will be further manipulated to allow for greater visiblility of the electrodes.</p>
        
        <h2>BrainMapper Outputs</h2>
        <p>When finished, BrainMapper generates two files that can be used to generate a 3D reconstructed model of the brain. The application will launch ITK-SNAP with these files loaded. Click on 'UPDATE MESH' in the corner of the bottom-left 3D View to render the reconstruction.'</p>
        <p>mri_brain.nii.gz is the base, grayscale image reqquired for viewing the 3D rendering. </p>
        <p>electrode_seg.nii.gz is the segmentation image required for viewing the electrodes.</p>
        <p> Additionally, preset label files are included for convenience.
