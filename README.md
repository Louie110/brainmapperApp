brainmapperApp
==============

This is the source code for the 3D Coregistration application developed at the University of Pennsylvania.

The IEEG-Portal uses the 3DVis-Coregistration-Tool package to create three-dimensional brain reconstructions that allow for visualization of subdural implanted electrodes on either a monochrome or parcellated brain.  The 3DVis-Coregistration Toolkit requires the post-implant CT and post-implant MRI to reconstruct the final 3D image.
